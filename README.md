_Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself._

_Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar to Haml. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, SCSS (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate rules within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively._

- Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
- Sass is an extension to CSS
- Sass is a CSS pre-processor
- Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
- Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
- Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
- Sass is free to download and use
